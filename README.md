- **Frontend**: React 18+, Recharts
- **Development**: Docker, Docker Compose
- **Performance Monitoring**: Custom metrics tracking

## 📋 Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- Node.js 16+
- Docker (optional)
- Modern web browser

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Using Docker (Recommended)
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/feature-store-demo.git

# Start the application
docker-compose up --build
```

### Manual Setup
```bash
# Backend setup
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# Frontend setup
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

## 💡 Implementation Details

### Backend Architecture
```python
class OptimizedFeatureStore:
    def __init__(self, data: pd.DataFrame):
        self.cache = {}
        self._precompute_features(data)

    async def get_features(self, user_id: int) -> Dict:
        if user_id in self.cache:
            return self.cache[user_id]
        # Compute and cache features...
```

### Frontend Visualization
```javascript
const improvement = (
    (basicTime - optimizedTime) / basicTime * 100
).toFixed(1);
```

## 📊 Performance Results

| Metric | Basic | Optimized | Improvement |
|--------|-------|-----------|-------------|
| Avg Response Time | ~100ms | ~2ms | 98% |
| Cache Hit Rate | 0% | >95% | 95% |
| Memory Usage | Base | Base + Cache | Configurable |

## 🔍 Demo Notes

This demo uses simulated database access times to illustrate feature store optimization principles. In production:
- Actual performance varies based on infrastructure
- Database access times fluctuate
- Network latency impacts results
- Data volume affects optimization benefits

## 🌟 Use Cases

1. **ML Model Serving**: Optimize feature computation for inference
2. **Real-time Applications**: Reduce latency for time-sensitive features
3. **Large-scale Systems**: Efficient feature serving for high-throughput scenarios
