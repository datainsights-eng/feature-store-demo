# Feature Store Performance Demo

This project demonstrates the performance impact of different feature store implementation patterns in ML systems. It showcases how techniques like caching, pre-computation, and optimized data access can significantly improve feature serving latency.

## Overview

The demo compares two feature store implementations:
- **Basic Implementation**: Simulates a simple feature store with on-demand computation and database access
- **Optimized Implementation**: Shows improved performance through caching and pre-computation

## Technical Implementation

### Backend (FastAPI)
- Feature computation and serving
- Performance metrics collection
- Simulated data access patterns

```python
# Example optimization pattern
class OptimizedFeatureStore:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.cache = {}
        self._precompute_features(data)

    async def get_features(self, user_id: int):
        if user_id in self.cache:
            return self.cache[user_id]
        # Compute and cache features...
```

### Frontend (React)
- Real-time performance visualization
- Interactive testing interface
- Metrics dashboard

```javascript
const improvement = (
    (basicTime - optimizedTime) / basicTime * 100
).toFixed(1);
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- Node.js 16+
- Docker (optional)

### Local Development Setup

1. **Backend Setup**
```bash
# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start the server
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

2. **Frontend Setup**
```bash
# Install dependencies
cd frontend
npm install

# Start development server
npm start
```

### Docker Setup
```bash
# Build and run with Docker Compose
docker-compose up --build
```

## Important Note

This demo uses simulated database access times to illustrate feature store optimization principles. In production environments:
- Actual performance improvements will vary based on infrastructure
- Database access times will not be constant
- Network latency will play a significant role
- Data volume will impact optimization effectiveness

## Performance Metrics

The demo shows several key metrics:
- Computation time for each implementation
- Cache hit/miss rates
- Performance improvement percentages
- Memory usage trade-offs
